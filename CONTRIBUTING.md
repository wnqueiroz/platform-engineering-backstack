# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! 🚀

Before submitting a new issue or pull request, please:

- **Check if an open issue already exists** for the problem or feature you intend to address.
- If a related issue already exists, consider contributing to the discussion there instead of opening a duplicate.

## How to Contribute

Follow these steps to contribute effectively:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:wnqueiroz/platform-engineering-backstack.git
   cd platform-engineering-backstack
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** using the following naming convention:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-<your-feature-name>
   ```

3. **Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) specification** when writing commit messages.

   A Conventional Commit is a lightweight convention for commit messages that provides a consistent way to structure the history of changes. The general format is:

   ```
   <type>(optional-scope): <description>
   ```

   Examples:

   - `feat: add new authentication flow`
   - `fix(login): correct password validation error`
   - `docs: update README with setup instructions`

   Common types include:

   - `feat`: a new feature
   - `fix`: a bug fix
   - `docs`: documentation only changes
   - `chore`: maintenance tasks (e.g., build system, CI)

4. **Push your branch** and open a **Pull Request** (PR) targeting the `main` branch.

5. In your PR description, link to any relevant issues and provide a clear summary of the changes you are proposing.
